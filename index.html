  <h1><center>TOP INFLUENCERS CRUSHING ON INSTAGRAM</center></h1>
    <p>&emsp;This visualization showcases the top 200 most followed influencers on Instagram 
      with data points represented as circles overlaid on a world map. The circle is made 
      up of the influencer picture/logo so that it can be easily identified by the person 
      looking at the visualization. The size of each circle determines the number of followers 
      the influencer has, meaning larger circles indicate more followers. This is an interactive 
      visualization and the people interacting with it can filter influencers based on the country 
      and view additional details like influence score, followers, average likes and posts through 
      an interactive card that is accessible on clicking the circle for a certain influencer. 
      Hovering over a circle shows a tooltip with the influencer’s Instagram handle. 
      The legend lists down all the possible interactions within the visualization. 
      The visualization combines spatial placement, filtering options and animated scaling. 
      The onload animation uses force simulations offered by D3.js with a certain delay to enhance user engagement. 
      There are animations on mouse hovering over the circles like enlarging the circle and image, 
      providing influencer’s Instagram handle and mouse click animations for the cards.</p>

    <p>Custom Visualization Category: Combinatorial<br>&emsp;This submission falls under the combinatorial 
      category of custom visualization. It combines several D3.js features and techniques to create an engaging 
      and interactive visualization of Instagram influencer data. The visualization uses a bubble chart where each 
      circle size represents the influencer Instagram followers count, with each circle displaying influencer picture/logo as background pattern. 
      It includes various interactive elements like tooltips, hover effects and clickable information cards to provide dynamic details about each influencer. 
      A filter menu allows viewers to view influencers based on specific countries and a legend helps the users understand the visual encodings in the visualization. 
      The visualization also employs force simulation to position the circles without overlap, ensuring a clear display in an 
      innovative way to enhance user engagement and functionality.</p>
